# 🐍 Snake Game in Python (Pygame)

This is my first attempt at building a game with Python using pygame. Control the snake, collect food, and avoid crashing into walls or yourself. A simple project to practice real-time input, collision detection, and game loops — a fun intro to 2D game development in Python.


## 🎯 Features

- Classic Snake gameplay on a 2D grid
- Real-time keyboard input handling
- Collision detection (self and wall)
- Randomized food spawning (avoids snake body)
- Score tracking and on-screen display
- Game over screen with final score


## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys to move the snake:
   - ⬅️ Left
   - ➡️ Right
   - ⬆️ Up
   - ⬇️ Down
2. Eat the magenta food squares to grow longer and increase your score.
3. Avoid hitting the walls or yourself.
4. The game ends on collision — your score is displayed on screen.
